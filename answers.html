    <h1> <U><CEnter>HTML INTERVIEW QUESTIONS</CEnter></U></h1>
    <H2>Answer-1 </H2>
    <H3>We can start an ordered list from 10 by setting start="10" in the (ol) element.</H3>
    <ol start="10">
  <li>Item one</li>
  <li>Item two</li>
  <li>Item three</li>
</ol>
 <H2>Answer-2 </H2>
 <h3> We use the < input > element with type="file" and specify the accepted file types using the accept attribute.</h3>
<input type="file" accept="./"C:\Users\harsh\.vscode">
<h2>Answer-3</h2><H3> <u>5 HTML tags:</u><br>
1 (< video>  Used to embed video content) <br>
2 (< audio>  Used to embed sound or audio content) <br>
3 (< nav>    Represents navigation links) <br>
4 (< header> Defines the header of a section or page) <br>
5 (< time>   Represents a specific time or date) <br>
<h2>Answer-4</h2>
<h3>DNS (Domain Name System)
 is a system that translates human-friendly domain names (like www.google.com) into computer-friendly IP addresses (like 142.250.190.4) that computers use to identify each other on the internet.
 When does DNS come into the picture?
DNS comes into the picture when you try to visit a website by typing its name (URL) in your browser.
<br> 
 <u>DNS Working</u>
<br>
1. We type www.example.com in your browser.
<br>
2. Your device sends a DNS request to find the IP address of that domain.
<br>
3. DNS responds with the correct IP address.
<br>
4. Your browser then connects to that IP to load the website.
</h3>
<h2>Answer-5</h2>
<h3>In HTML (HyperText Markup Language), "markup" refers to the system 
    of using tags to define and structure content on a webpage. These tags,
     enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., < h1>, < p>, < a>), instruct the web 
        browser on how to display text, images, links, and other elements.
         Unlike programming languages that perform logic or calculations,
         HTML markup focuses solely on the presentation and organization 
         of content.</h3> 
         <h2>Answer-6</h2>
         <h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of enhancing your website to improve its visibility on search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. The goal is to attract more organic (non-paid) traffic by aligning your content with what users are searching for
    </h3> 
    <h2>Answer-7</h2>
    <h3>Inspect Element is a powerful tool integrated into modern web browsers that allows you to view and interact with the underlying HTML and CSS of a webpage. It's invaluable for web developers, designers, and anyone interested in understanding or modifying the structure and style of a webpage in real-time.
</h3> 
<h2>Answer-8</h2>
<H3>Webpage designing is the process of creating and arranging the visual and functional elements of a website to ensure it is both attractive and easy to use. It involves planning the layout, choosing colors and fonts, adding images, and organizing content so that visitors can navigate the site effortlessly and find the information they need.</H3>
    <H2>Answer-9</H2>
<H3>To open a link in a new window or tab using an anchor (< a>) tag in HTML, you can use the target="_blank" attribute. 
<BR>
    <a href="https://www.Google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>
<BR>
: href: Specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
<Br>
: target="_blank": Instructs the browser to open the linked document in a new window or tab</H3>

<H2>Answer-10</H2>
<H3>The viewport meta tag provides instructions to the browser on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.allowing websites to adapt their layout and content to fit different screen sizes and orientations.
</H3>
    <H2>Answer-11</H2>
    <h3>Attributes are added to HTML tags in the opening tag and are written as name-value pairs. The name specifies the property, and the value defines its setting</h3>
<h2>Answer-12</h2>
<H3>The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the internet's phonebook. It translates human-friendly website names (like www.example.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1). DNS helps your computer find the correct website by converting the website's name into an IP address that it can understand and connect </H3>

<H2>Answer-13</H2>
<h3> IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique number assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the IP addres for communication
</H3>
<h2>Answer-14</h2>
<h3>When you type localhost in your web browser, the request doesn't go out to the internet.it is routed back to your own computer. This allows you to access services, such as web servers or databases, that are running locally on your machine. It's commonly used by developers to test websites or applications before making them publicly accessible. </h3>
<h2>Answer-15</h2>
<h3>HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, introduced to address the limitations of HTML4 and to meet the evolving needs of modern web development</h3>

<h2>Answer-16</h2>
<h3>Semantic tags in HTML are elements that clearly describe their meaning in both human- and machine-readable ways. These tags define the structure and content of a webpage, making it easier for browsers, search engines to interpret and display the content appropriately.</h3>
<h2>Answer-17</h2>
<h3>HTML5 introduced several significant features that enhanced the structure, functionality, and interactivity of web pages. </h3>

<h2>Answer-35</h2>
<h3>HTML contains 6 types of heading elements, ranging from < h1> to < h6>
<br>
<br>< h1> is the highest or most important level heading (typically used for the main title)
<br>
< h6> is the lowest or least important level heading (used for sub-subsections, etc.)
<br>
<br>
 <u>Tag	Description</u> <br>
< h1>	Main heading (most important) <br>
< h2>	Subheading <br>
< h3>	Sub-subheading <br>
< h4>	Level 4 heading <br>
< h5>	Level 5 heading <br>
< h6>	Level 6 heading (least important)
</h3>

<h2>Answer-36</h2>
<h3>In HTML, heading tags range from < h1> to < h6>, each representing a level of importance in the document's structure.
<br>
<br>
<u>Highest Priority: < h1></u> – Represents the main topic or title of the page.
<br>
<u>Lowest Priority: < h6> </u>– Used for minor subsections or less important content.

</h3>
<h2>Answer-37</h2>
<h2>To create a hyperlink in HTML, you use the < a> (anchor) tag, which stands for "anchor." The most important attribute of this tag is (href) which specifies the destination URL. 
<br>
<br>
<u>< a href="https://www.google.com">Google< /a></u>

  <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
</h2>
<h2>Answer-38</h2>
<h3>The HTML tag used to display data in a tabular format is < table>. This element, along with its related tags—< tr>, < th>, and < td>—allows you to structure data into rows and columns.</h3>  
<h2>Answer-39</h2>
  <h3>Group columns for centralized styling
Using < colgroup> with < col> allows you to apply CSS like width, background, border, or visibility to entire columns without repeating styles for each cell 
<br> 
. The < colgroup> tag encapsulates and organizes column definitions.
  <br>

. Combined with < col>, it lets you style multiple columns efficiently  </h3>
<h2>Answer-40</h2>
<h3>Common lists use in html for designing web page :- <br>
  <br>
<u>1. Unordered Lists(< ul> + < li>)</u><br>
Use case: Items with no specific order (e.g. grocery lists, feature lists, navigation menus). <ul>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>

<u>2. Ordered Lists(< ol> + < li>)</u><br>
Use case: When the order matters (e.g. steps, ranked lists)

<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 180°C.</li>
  <li>Mix ingredients.</li>
  <li>Bake for 30 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<u>3. Definition Lists (< dl> + < dt> + < dd>)</u><br>
Use case: Pairing terms with definitions or descriptions 
<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
</dl>

<h3>An HTML tag is simply the markup you type—the text inside < > such as < p> or < /div>. Tags tell the browser, “Here begins or ends this element,” but by themselves they don’t represent the full structure</h3>
<u>Example:- < p>This is an element.< /p></u>
<h3> the < p> and < /p> tags, plus the text in between, together form a paragraph element </h3>
<h2>Answer-44</h2>
<h3>Semantic HTML means using HTML tags that describe the meaning of the content, not just how it looks.
<u>For example: 
</u>
<br>
< nav> is clearly a navigation menu
<br>
< header> is the page or section header
<br>
< article> is a standalone piece of content
These tags tell browsers and users what the content is, not just how to show it

<h3>An image map in HTML lets you make different parts of a single image clickable—each one acting like its own link—without slicing the image into pieces 
  <br>
  <br>
  <u>(1)< img> with usemap="#mapname"</u>
   <br>
. Tells the browser this image has an associated clickable map 
<br>
<br>

<h3>To insert a copyright symbol (©) on a browser page, you can use the HTML entity (& copy); or the character code (& #169);. Alternatively, on Windows, you can type Alt + 0169. 

<br>
<u> & copy;</u>
<br>
This is the standard HTML entity for the copyright symbol. You can place it directly within your HTML code where you want the symbol to appear.
<br>
<u>& #169;</u>
<br>
This is the decimal character code for the copyright symbol. It also works when placed in your HTML. </h3>
<h2>Answer-47</h2>
<h3>To create a nested webpage in HTML—meaning embedding one page inside another
  <br>
  <br>

  <u>1. Use of < iframe></u>
<br>
<br>
<u>< iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/" width="600" height="400" title="youtube">< /iframe></u>
  <br>
  <br>
  . < iframe> defines a rectangular region in your page and embeds another webpage within it
  <br>
  <br>
  . You can adjust the size using width and height, and add sandbox (e.g., sandbox="allow-scripts") for extra security
<br>
<br>
<u>2. Use <  embed></u> 
<br>
<br>
<u>< embed src="https://example.com" type="text/html" width="600" height="400">
</u>
<br>
<br>
. < embed> also embeds external HTML content.
<br>
<br>
. It’s less commonly used for full pages, but works similarly
</h3>
<h2>Answer-48</h2>
<h3>. < iframe> (inline frame) embeds another webpage or document inside your page—like a window to
   another site
  <br>
  . It creates a separate browsing context, isolating the embedded content from your main page (styles and scripts don’t overlap)

</h3>
<h3><u>Use of it</u>
<br>
. Embed third‑party content — like YouTube videos, maps, or widgets.
<br>

. Sandbox external pages — perfect for displaying user-submitted content without affecting your main 
page
<br>
. Display cross-domain content — even if the content comes from a different site, securely inside your page.
<br>
<br>
<u>Example :-</u>
<br>
< iframe src="https://example.com"
        width="600"
        height="400"
        title="Example Site">
  Your browser doesn’t support iframes.
< /iframe> 
<br>
<br>
. src: URL of the embedded page
<br>
. width / height: size of the iframe (can be pixels or %)
<br>
. title: important for screen-reader accessibility 
<br>
. Fallback text appears if iframes aren’t supported
</h3>

<h2>Answer-49</h2>
<h3>The most important iframe attributes are src, width, height, and title, as they define the embedded content and its display size, while title provides accessibility information. Other attributes like sandbox, loading, and allow are also important for security and performance considerations. 
<br>
<br>
<u>src:</u>
<br>
This attribute specifies the URL of the webpage or document that will be embedded within the iframe. It's essential for the iframe to display any content. 
<br>
<br>
<u>width and height:</u>
<br>
These attributes define the dimensions (width and height) of the iframe, specifying how much space it will occupy on the page. 
<br>
<br>
<u>title:</u>
<br>
The title attribute provides a description of the iframe's content, which is crucial for accessibility. Screen readers use this information to help users understand the iframe's purpose. 
<br>
<br>
<u>sandbox:</u>
<br>
This attribute is important for security. It allows you to enable a set of restrictions on the content within the iframe, preventing potentially harmful actions like running scripts or submitting forms without proper authorization. 
<br>
<br>
<u>allow:</u>
<br>
The allow attribute grants specific permissions to the iframe, such as allowing fullscreen display, autoplay, or access to the camera. 
<br>
<br>
<u>loading:</u>
<br>
The loading attribute, set to "lazy", can improve page load performance by deferring the loading of iframes that are not immediately visible on the page.

<h2>Answer-86</h2>
<h3><ins>Markup Language :-</ins><br>
A markup language is a system for annotating a document to specify its structure, formatting, and relationships. In HTML, this involves using tags like < p>, < h1>, and < a> to define paragraphs, headings, and links, respectively. These tags instruct the browser on how to display the content.
<br>
  <ins>Hypertext :-</ins><br>
Hypertext refers to text that contains links (hyperlinks) to other texts or documents. In HTML, the < a> tag creates hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between different pages or sections. This interconnected structure is fundamental to the World Wide Web.

<h2>Answer-87</h2>
<h3><ins>Normal Links (:Links)</ins><br>
 A normal link is a hyperlink that has not been visited yet by the user.
<br>Typically displayed in blue and underlined, though this can vary based on browser defaults and custom styles.
<br>
CSS Pseudo-class link is used to style unvisited links.
<br>
<ins>Active Links (:active)</ins><br>
Definition: An active link is a hyperlink that is being clicked by the user, specifically during the time the mouse button is pressed down.
<br>
Appearance: Often styled with a different color or background to provide feedback that the link is being activated.
<br>
CSS Pseudo-class active is used to style links during the click action.
